**Author:** Duc Anh Pham  
**Date:** January 14, 2026  
**Lab:** CompTIA Network+  

## Short Description
This home lab demonstrates **network segmentation using VLANs** on a single Cisco switch. Four PCs represent different departments—Sales, Marketing, Accounting, and Finance—and VLANs are used to isolate their network traffic, simulating an enterprise-like setup.  

## Lab Objectives
- Understand the purpose and benefits of VLANs for network segmentation  
- Create and name VLANs on a Cisco switch  
- Assign switch ports to specific VLANs according to departmental roles  
- Verify VLAN configuration and port membership  
- Demonstrate logical separation of network traffic  

The full lab documentation, including step-by-step implementation, network diagrams, and verification results, is provided in the attached PDF:
