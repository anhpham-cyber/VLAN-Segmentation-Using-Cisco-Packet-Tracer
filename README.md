# VLAN Segmentation Home Lab

**Author:** Duc Anh Pham  
**Date:** January 14, 2026  
**Lab:** CompTIA Network+  

## Short Description
This home lab demonstrates **network segmentation using VLANs** on a single Cisco switch. Four PCs represent different departments—Sales, Marketing, Accounting, and Finance—and VLANs are used to isolate their network traffic, simulating an enterprise-like setup.  

## Lab Objectives
- Understand the purpose and benefits of VLANs for network segmentation  
- Create and name VLANs on a Cisco switch  
- Assign switch ports to specific VLANs according to departmental roles  
- Verify VLAN configuration and port membership  
- Demonstrate logical separation of network traffic  

## Files in this Repository
- **[VLAN Segmentation Using Cisco Packet Tracer.pdf]** – Full lab documentation with step-by-step implementation and diagrams  
- **VLANs setup.pkt** – Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the lab configuration  

This project is intended for learning VLAN configuration, switch management, and network segmentation principles.
